Fun little project for main website

## Use
If you decide for whatever reason to host my website, then firstly thanks. There are a few things you need to do first.

## Assuming you've got node and npm
Run this like any other node package. `npm install` and then `npm run`!

### Install node and npm
This website uses nodejs, and npm to manage the requirements; they need to be installed on your system.

#### Ubuntu
`sudo apt install nodejs-legacy npm`
#### Debian
`sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`
#### Arch
`sudo pacman -S nodejs npm`
#### Fedora
`sudo dnf install nodejs npm`
#### Windows
`install a proper OS and come back to this`
